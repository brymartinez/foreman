# Decision log

This file records every decision point, in order, whether the user or an agent made it.
Add an entry whenever a choice shapes behavior, architecture, scope, or tooling. Never
rewrite an old entry. If a decision is reversed, mark the old entry
`Superseded by Dn` and add a new one.

Entry format:

```
## Dn. Title
- Date / Stage / Decided by (user | agent)
- Context: why a choice was needed
- Options: what was considered
- Decision: what was chosen
- Consequence: what it changes
```

## D1. Implementation language: Go

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the user, following the agent's recommendation.
- **Context.** The design doc defaulted to TypeScript/Bun unless there was a concrete
  reason not to. The tool will be packaged and distributed as an executable.
- **Options.** A. TypeScript + Bun (`bun build --compile`). B. Go.
- **Decision.** B.
- **Consequence.** The stripped Go binary is 1.8 MB, where the Bun compiled binary was
  59 MB. os/exec gives solid control over the detached runner process, and the YAML v3
  Node API keeps comments and key order in files the user edits. What's lost is
  TypeScript's union types, so outcomes are validated by `agent.ParseOutcome` and the
  strict JSON schema.

## D2. Go toolchain upgraded to 1.27.1 through Homebrew

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the user ("update Go"). The agent chose the
  install method.
- **Context.** Go 1.23.0 was installed at `/usr/local/go`. Replacing that install needs sudo.
- **Options.** A. Homebrew `go`, which comes earlier in PATH. B. The official pkg
  installer, which needs sudo. C. `GOTOOLCHAIN` auto-download.
- **Decision.** A.
- **Consequence.** `/opt/homebrew/bin/go` is 1.27.1 and `go.mod` says `go 1.27.1`. The
  old `/usr/local/go` is still installed but no longer used.

## D3. Binary name: `foreman`

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the user.
- **Context.** The design doc wrote its examples as `dev inbox` and so on.
- **Options.** A. Ship the binary as `dev`. B. Ship it as `foreman`.
- **Decision.** B. The binary is `foreman`, and no `dev` alias is shipped or documented.
- **Consequence.** Usage text and docs use `foreman <command>`.

## D4. Agent execution: headless turns with a structured outcome

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Context.** The tool has to tell when an agent is blocked on a decision, without
  scraping the terminal.
- **Options.** A. Interactive sessions with terminal or PTY scraping. B. Headless turns
  (`claude -p --json-schema`, `codex exec --output-schema`) whose final message follows
  a schema.
- **Decision.** B. Every turn ends as `pr_opened`, `blocked` (with a question), or `failed`.
- **Consequence.** A blocked agent ends its turn instead of waiting for input.
  `respond` resumes the same session by ID. Verified for both CLIs by
  `scripts/probe-agents.sh`.

## D5. One detached runner process per task, no daemon

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Context.** Agent turns take minutes to hours. The design doc rules out daemons and
  polling.
- **Options.** A. Run the agent in the foreground of `start`. B. Have `start` and
  `respond` spawn a detached `foreman` runner for that one task, which exits when the
  task needs the human or finishes. C. A daemon.
- **Decision.** B.
- **Consequence.** The runner's pid and log path go in the task file. `inbox` and
  `status` check liveness and CI when the user runs them.

## D6. Who pushes and opens the PR: foreman (superseded by D7)

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Context.** It hadn't been verified whether Codex's sandbox could reach GitHub
  credentials.
- **Decision.** Foreman would run `git push` and `gh pr create` after the agent returned
  `ready_for_pr`.
- **Status.** Superseded by D7.

## D7. The implementation agent pushes and opens the PR

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the user.
- **Context.** The design doc makes the implementation agent responsible for
  `git push` / `gh pr create`. The user reversed D6.
- **Options.** A. Foreman pushes and opens the PR (D6). B. The agent does both.
- **Decision.** B.
- **Consequence.** The outcome status `ready_for_pr` with a PR title and body is
  replaced by `pr_opened` with `prNumber` and `prUrl`. Foreman checks with `gh` that the
  PR exists before moving to REVIEWING. Codex runs with
  `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`. The probe confirmed that `gh api user`
  and an authenticated `git ls-remote` work inside the Codex sandbox. `Push` and
  `CreatePullRequest` were removed from the ports.

## D8. Agent permissions

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Context.** Unattended Claude denies shell commands that aren't pre-approved, and the
  `auto` permission mode denied them too. Codex `workspace-write` has no network.
- **Options.** A. `bypassPermissions` / `--dangerously-bypass-*`. B. Claude with
  `acceptEdits` and a configured `--allowedTools` list, and Codex with `workspace-write`
  plus network access.
- **Decision.** B. The dangerous flags are never the default.
- **Consequence.** The default Claude allowlist has to cover git, gh, and the repo's
  test and build commands. Denials appear in `permission_denials` and are treated as
  failures.

## D9. Storage: one Markdown file per repo and number

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent, within the design doc's constraints.
- **Context.** The design doc asks for human-editable Markdown with YAML frontmatter and
  no SQLite.
- **Decision.** Files are named `<owner>-<repo>-<number>.md` in a configurable
  directory. Frontmatter holds machine state. The body is round-tripped byte for byte.
  Items that are seen but not delegated are saved as `DISCOVERED`, so the inbox
  remembers what the user has already seen.
- **Consequence.** No lock file is needed. The runner writes only its own task's file.

## D10. Reviewers get disposable sessions built from durable state

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Decision.** The reviewer runs with `--no-session-persistence` / `--ephemeral`. Its
  input is the issue, the context file, and the diff against the base. It never receives
  the implementer's conversation. It uses the same `codex exec` / `claude -p` path with a
  review schema, not `codex exec review`, so both reviewers work the same way.

## D11. The review loop is capped

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the agent.
- **Decision.** The default is 3 fix and re-review rounds. After that the task becomes
  NEEDS_DECISION with the outstanding findings.
- **Consequence.** The loop can't run forever when the two agents keep disagreeing.

## D12. Branch and worktree naming

- Date: 2026-09-24. Stage 0. Decided by the user (related to the issue, a standard
  slugged format, a word cap). The agent chose the exact rules.
- **Context.** Claude, Codex, and the user all need one predictable name for a task's
  branch and checkout.
- **Decision.** `WorkName = <issue>-<slug>`. The slug is the issue title lowercased, with
  any leading conventional-commit prefix (`feat(x): `) removed, common accents folded to
  ASCII, and non-alphanumeric runs turned into `-`. It keeps at most 5 words and at most
  40 characters, cut on a word boundary. A title that produces nothing becomes `issue`.
  The branch is `agent/<WorkName>`. The worktree is
  `<worktrees root>/<owner>-<repo>/<WorkName>`.
- **Example.** Issue 825, "Provider retries", becomes branch
  `agent/825-provider-retries` in `…/ridezoomo-armada-backend/825-provider-retries`.
- **Consequence.** The name is computed once at `start` and stored in the task file.
  Editing the title later doesn't rename anything. The code is in `internal/task/naming.go`.
